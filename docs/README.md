Hello :wave:!

My name is Michael. I'm a techie who is passionate about cloud native technologies :computer: and personal finance :dollar:.

Recently I've been working on setting up a private home cloud, [check it out](private_cloud/index.md)!

I love open-source and everything I do outside of work can be found on my [github page](https://github.com/michaeldbianchi)
